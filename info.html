                    <h1>Who I am</h1>
                    <p>My name is Maxwell Dean Claypool, but you can just call me Max. My family and I lived in the country for quite a long time. Jack and I used to make our own fun and had to find things to do, being in the country and all.There were fun times, like going sledding in the backyard, playing soccer, LARPing, and also playing games on our wii.(Super Mario Galaxy for fun, Mario Party 8 to make enemies haha) Later, my parents split their separate ways and me and my brother went back and forth between. At my mother's I would just talk to the neighbor kids and play with them.We used to do stupid stuff like pushing unmanned bikes down hills and running in the cornfields. My dad wanted to teach us character, so he had us do some work over at his house.(Always fun)I, like most other kids, was huge fanatic of Minecraft... well... 'AM' would probably would be a more truthful answer. I started getting into java 8 so I could make mods, and I made some texure packs.I never really got into modpacks too deeply, of course, other than the rogers cadenhead tutorial plugin I made for practice.Around this time, I started to look into the hardware components and operating systems and overall system navigation inadvertently.This would mark the beginning of learning to build a computer.Later on there was some more moving, got deeper into the city and near the highschool which is very convenient.I was a little bit of a trouble maker in school, however, my grades were decent.By decent, I mean I had grades around the C-B range to be honest...Eventually, nearing the end of high school I was kind of lost...I went to college, however, I ended up uncertain of whether or not to continue so I dropped out. Worked a food service job, landscaping and maintainance job, and a factory job. I have always had an interest in computers and I am sure that this is the path I would like to pursue more than any else.
